          <h1> About </h1>
          <p> Tourism in Sri Lanka is growing rapidly. For centuries, Sri Lanka has been a popular place of attraction for foreign travelers. The Chinese traveler Fa-Hien visited Sri Lanka as early as the 410's AD/CE, and in the twelfth century, Italian explorer Marco Polo claimed Sri Lanka to be the "best island of its size in the world". </p>

          <h1> When will Sri Lanka open its borders to foreigners? </h1>
          <p class="text"> The Sri Lankan government re-opened its borders in January 2021, creating a Bio-security travel bubble for tourists within 'safe and secure level 1' accredited hotels. Initially, visitors were required to stay within the bubble for 14 days but since April, vaccinated travellers have been able to travel freely throughout the country, initially after a negative PCR test result on arrival but now on proof of a recent negative test.</p>
        
         <h2> Is Sri Lanka on the UK 'Go' list? <h2>
          <p class="text"> Yes, Sri Lanka was removed from the UK's 'red' and added to the 'go' list back in September 2021.</p>
          
          <h2>Does the FCDO advise against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka? </h2>
          <p class="text"> There is no COVID 19 specific FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office) advice in place for travel to Sri Lanka. This means that the UK government do not believe there is any specific risk relating to COVID 19 whilst you are there. In turn, this means that most standard insurance policies will be valid for your trip.</p>
          
          <h2> What are vaccination levels like in Sri Lanka? </h2>
          <p class="text"> After a slow start to their vaccination program, Sri Lanka is making good progress with 64% of the population fully vaccinated and 74% receiving at least one dose as of early December 2021. Teenagers are currently being vaccinated and booster doses are being offered to front-line health care workers. </p>
          
          <h2> Do I need to be fully vaccinated to get into Sri Lanka? </h2>
          <p class="text"> No, you do not need to be fully vaccinated to get into Sri Lanka as the original Bio-secure bubble still exists. However, if you are not fully vaccinated, you will not be able to leave the bubble (unless to leave the country) for 14 days.  We suggest not travelling to Sri Lanka without being vaccinated as once you have left the bio bubble there might well still be problems getting into monuments, public transport and hotels - a number are only accepting fully vaccinated guests.  
          For travellers aged between 12 and 18, if you have had one Pfizer jab then that counts you as fully vaccinated.  Otherwise, children aged 12 to 18 will have to take a test within the first 24 hours of landing in Sri Lanka.  Children aged under 12 count as vaccinated if their parents are.</p>
              
          <img src="images/blog 5.jpeg" alt="featured places"> 
          <h2> What are the rules for vaccinated travellers? </h2> 
          <p class="text"> Fully vaccinated travellers are able to travel freely as soon as they arrive in Sri Lanka, providing they have a negative result from a PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure and have proof of their vaccination status. Once in the country, there are no restrictions on what they can do and where they can go, although mask-wearing is mandatory.  Although we suggest having copies of vaccination certification and passport on hand particularly for public transport and getting into monuments.</p>
          
          <h2>What are the rules for unvaccinated travellers?</h2> 
          <p class="text"> Unvaccinated travellers must stay within the Bio-security travel bubble for 14 days (unless to leave the country). The bubble consists of hotels that have been given Level 1 'Safe & Secure' status by SLDTA (Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority) and travellers cannot leave the hotel, unless to transfer between level 1 hotels or visit approved excursions and sites. However, while at the hotel, guests can move around the grounds freely. 
            Level 1 is a status given to hotels by SLDTA (Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority) and means they are within the Bio-secure bubble. Hotels have to meet certain requirements to be able to apply for this status and can only accept guests that are within the bubble and are not open to local guests or tourists that have left the bubble. They also have procedures in place to reduce the risk of COVID cases making it into the bubble from the local community or vice versa. 
           It is worth noting that with the relaxation in the rules on vaccinated travellers, we do not expect there to be a large network of Level 1 hotels available for the bio-bubble from the Autumn onwards. </p>
